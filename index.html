<!-- Good times + crazy friends = amazing memories.
Together is a wonderful place to be.
Partners in crime forever.
No one gets me like you do
We’re the perfect mix of trouble and fun.
Different people, same level of crazy.
With you, every moment turns into a memory.
"Friends come and go like waves, but the real ones stick like glue
you always know how to make me smile
Why do you cry every birthday? Do you want to remember your first cry? You should smile because your parents smiled when you cried for the first time 
Thank your parents for me — they brought such a beautiful light into the world, and named her Selene.
Please convey my heartfelt thanks to your parents — they created such a gorgeous soul like you, Selene.
"Happy Birthday, dear Selene! Thank you for being the light in my darkest nights. Your smile shines like the stars, and you’ve gifted me one of the most wonderful memories of my life."
Do you remember that? When I gave you this card, do you remember what happened next?"-->
